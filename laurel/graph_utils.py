  First, generates a network of depots and connections between them according to

  time-expanded representation is then generated from the original network by
  sampling a pre-specified number of trucks at each time step, each of which
  starts at the current time step and ends a random number of time steps later
  (taking care to not exceed the specified total number of time steps). Parcels
  may be added with the `make_random_parcels` function.

  Args:
    rng: Random number generator.
    num_hubs: Number of depots in the network.
    timesteps: Number of time steps.
    num_trucks_per_step: Number of trucks leaving every time step
      (deterministic).

      its destination. The actual number is sampled uniformly from {1, ...,
      `max_truck_duration`}.
    max_truck_capacity: The maximum scalar capacity of trucks. The actual
      capacity is sampled uniformly from [0, `max_truck_capacity`).
    unit_capacities: If `True`, all truck capacities are set to 1. The argument
      `max_truck_capacity` is ignored in this case.
    truck_sampling_inv_temp: When sampling the trucks for a given time step,
      probabilities for the trucks are given by `softmax(truck_sampling_inv_temp
      * (degree_truck_sender + degree_truck_receiver))`. This way, trucks
      connecting two high-degree nodes are sampled more frequently.

    new_edge_p: The `p` parameter of the extended Barab치si-Albert model [1].

      are of the form (edge id, forward truck?, backward truck?, forward
      parcel?, backward parcel?, forward virtual?, backward virtual?, capacity
      if truck, weight if parcel).
    - `network` is the non-expanded network as a NetworkX graph. This network
      has edge weights of `truck_sampling_inv_temp * (degree_sender +
      degree_receiver)`. As this is the probability of sampling a truck, the
      edge weights give information about the frequency of a connection.

  """Adds random parcels to a time-expanded transportation network.

  The network may be created using `make_random_network`, whose outputs can be
  passed as `state, network, distances`. This function adds parcels to the
  network by first sampling a parcel weight (from a truncated Pareto
  distribution [1]), a start node from the time expanded network, and then
  sampling trucks to make a parcel route. Routes end probabilistically after
  each truck to give an average route length of `mean_route_length`. The
  time-expanded network (`state`) should normally be pruned (using
  `prune_network` with `prune_parcels=False`) before adding parcels with this
  function. This method ensures that the network is completely solvable.

  Args:
    rng: Random number generator.
    state: Time-expanded transportation network in the format as generated by
      `make_random_network`. Parcels are added to a copy of this network, which
      is returned.
    network: Non-expanded (NetworkX) network corresponding to `state` (also
      returned by `make_random_network`).
    distances: Resistance distance matrix of `network`, as returned by
      `make_random_network`. This is used for sampling trucks in such a way that
      they are more likely to bring the parcel further from their start hub. How
      much this is taken into account is conrolled by the `dist_inv_temp`
      parameter.
    num_parcels: Number of parcels to be included in the network.
    mean_route_length: Average length of a parcel route (in time steps). After
      each time step of a parcel route, it is randomly decided whether to
      terminate the route, with probability 1 / `mean_route_length`. This way, a
      parcel route lasts `sum((1 - 1 / mean_route_length)**k)` time steps in
      expectation. This geometric sum approaches `mean_route_length` as the
      number of time steps in `state` becomes larger.
    min_parcel_weight: The scale (`m`) parameter of the Pareto distribution [1]
      from which parcel weights are sampled.
    max_parcel_weight: The maximum weight of parcels. The parcel weights are
      sampled from a truncated Pareto distribution using rejection sampling to
      keep weights below `max_parcel_weight`.
    parcel_weight_shape: The shape (`a`) parameter of the Pareto distribution
      [1] from which parcel weights are sampled.
    unit_weights: If `True`, all parcel weights are set to 1 instead of being
      sampled from a Pareto distribution.
    start_inv_temp: The start node hub is sampled from a Boltzmann distribution
      with exponent `-start_inv_temp * degree(hub)` to preferably start at hubs
      with lower degree.
    dist_inv_temp: When sampling parcel routes it is often posssible to choose
      between multiple trucks. In these cases, the truck is chosen among the
      available trucks by sampling from a Boltzmann distribution with exponent
      `dist_inv_temp * dist_from_start` (where the distance to the start node is
      measured in terms of resistance distance, i.e. `distances`). This
      encourages parcels to go further from their start nodes.
    max_tries: If, after a parcel route has been sampled, this parcel route
      doesn't actually use any real trucks (instead, the parcel just stays at
      its start hub), we try again. This is done for a maximum of `max_tries`
      times (after which a 'staying' parcel route will simply be accepted). The
      parcel weight is reduced by 10% each try to make it easier to place the
      parcel.
    cut_capacities: After all parcels have been placed in the network, there is
      normally still capacity left in some trucks. `cut_capacities` is a number
      between 0 and 1 that specifies how much of this excess capacity should be
      removed (by reducing the trucks' capacities). Thus, 1 means all excess
      capacity is cut and 0 means no capacity is cut.

  Returns:
    The new state (time-expanded network), now with `num_parcels` parcels added,
    as well a dictionary mapping each parcel id to a list of nodes (in
    (location, time) format) representing a solution route for that parcel.

  """Removes nodes and edges from network that are not relevant.

  If `prune_parcels` is `True`, then this function checks, or every parcel in
  the network, which nodes and trucks are reachable from the start node (forward
  in time) and from the goal node (backward in time). The final network consists
  of the union of reachable nodes and trucks for all parcels.

  Regardless of `prune_parcels`, nodes which have only one incoming and one
  outgoing connection (and are neither the start nor the end node for a parcel)
  are removed from the network, and edges to skip these nodes are inserted.

  Args:
    network: Time-expanded transportation network ('state') in the format as
      generated by `make_random_network` with parcels as added by
      `make_random_parcels`. Not modified in-place.
    prune_parcels: Whether to only keep nodes and edges relevant to the parcels
      in the network (`True`), or to ignore parcels and only remove skippable
      nodes (`False`).
    solution: If provided, the node ids in these routes are modified to
      correspond to those in the pruned network. Not modified in-place.

  Returns:
    - A new logistics network where unreachable trucks and nodes as well as
      skippable nodes have been removed from the original one.
    - A dictionary containing a list of all skipped nodes for each newly
      inserted edge.
    - A dictionary containing, for each unpruned edge, a list of all parcels
      which include this edge in their pruned graph. This is important in
      feature graph construction to understand which parcels from outside the
      feature graph might affect truck capacities inside the feature graph.
      If `prune_parcels == False`, then this is `None`.
    - If `solution` is provided, a corresponding new `solution` dict is also
      returned, otherwise this is `None`.
